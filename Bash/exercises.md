# You need to show only files that don't repeat the filename, so you ignore extension.
# For example:
#
# foo.mp3|bar.txt|baz.mp3
# thud.mp3
#
# Line 1 all filenames are unique
# Line 2 all filenames repeat so all are ignored
# Line 3 all quux are ignored cause they repeat

foo.mp3|bar.txt|baz.mp3
wub.mp3|wub.mp3|wub.mp3|wub.txt|wub.png
quux.mp3|quux.txt|thud.mp3
